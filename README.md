# Car Rental and Listing Website

Welcome to the Car Rental and Listing Website project! This application allows users to rent and list cars. It features a Node.js backend with MySQL and a React frontend. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally.

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Set Up the Database

1. **Run the Database Schema**

   Execute the `Database.sql` file to create the required database and tables:

   ```bash
   mysql -u <username> -p < Database.sql
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with your MySQL username.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   DB_HOST=<your-database-host>
   DB_USER=<your-database-username>
   DB_PASSWORD=<your-database-password>
   DB_DATABASE=<your-database-name>
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.

### 3. Set Up the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Backend Server**

   Run the backend server with:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

### 4. Set Up the Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Application**

   Launch the React application with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- Ensure your MySQL server is running and accessible.
- Double-check that the `.env` file is properly configured with your database credentials.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, make sure:
- All dependencies are installed correctly.
- The database schema has been properly set up.
- Environment variables in the `.env` file are accurate.


Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance. Happy coding!

### Key Points:
- **Headers and Sections**: Use headers to organize the content clearly.
- **Code Blocks**: Format code blocks with triple backticks for better readability.
- **Lists and Links**: Use lists for steps and links for licenses and additional information.

Replace placeholders like `<repository-url>`, `<username>`, `<your-database-host>`, etc., with your actual details. This format is clean, professional, and suitable for a GitHub repository.
